# Listening Party Bot
![Blahaj](https://i.imgur.com/NuEmaM9.png)

A Discord bot used to set up, organize, and host listening parties for Spotify playlists or albums! 

**Use the following URL to invite the bot to your server:**\
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1062043789646118982&permissions=18432&scope=bot

(Make sure the permissions for sending messages and embedding links are checked, otherwise the bot won't work.)

## Basic Usage
Once the bot is invited to your server, make sure it has writing permissions. Once that's done, you can manage listening parties on a per-channel basis (threads aren't supported yet). Here is how you do that:

1. Type `/set` and pass a URL to a Spotify album or playlist (you can get the link by right-clicking on the playlist or album and selecting _Share â†’ Copy Album/Playlist Link_):
![/set](https://i.imgur.com/fHAfr7J.png)


2. The bot will then verify and preprocess the given playlist or album. If everything looks good, a message will pop up, saying that everything is ready, along with a link to the target, so that everyone can get ready:

3. Type `/start` to start the actual listening party. A custom countdown (in seconds) can be passed to this command. By default, it's 5 seconds. \

And that's it! From here on out, the bot will provide detailed information about whichever song is currently playing in a synchronized manner. When possible, it will also display some additional information of the current song from [last.fm's wiki](https://www.last.fm/music/Rammstein/_/Ohne+dich/+wiki):

## Commands
Here's a full list of every command and what it does:

### `/nowplaying` or `/np`
Print info of the currently ongoing Listening Party for this channel. Useful for late joiners, because it also displays the timestamp of the current song:
